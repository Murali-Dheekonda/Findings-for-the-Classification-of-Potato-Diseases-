For farming and food security, detecting potato diseases is crucial. We discovered early on that crops can suffer greatly from the symptoms of both Early Blight (caused by Alternaria solani) and Late Blight (produced by Phytophthora infestans). Generally speaking, farmers would welcome an automated system that detects these problems early. As a result, a system based on transfer learning and convolutional neural networks divides potato leaves into three groups: healthy, early blight, and late blight. This eliminates the need for expensive manual checks. In general, automating the diagnosing procedure can increase overall production and reduce crop losses.
